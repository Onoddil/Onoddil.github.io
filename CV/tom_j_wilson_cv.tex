%	OBJECTIVE SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
% \section{RESEARCH INTERESTS}  

% My main interest in astrophysics involves the understanding of early star formation, from cloud core through to cluster evolution along the pre-main-sequence. Specifically, the application of robust statistical methodology to investigations to explore and explain these complex astrophysical processes. Understanding the consequences of the way we observe the universe and characterising how our assumptions influence our conclusions also drive my interests in the field.

\section{PROFESSIONAL WORK}

{\sl Postdoctoral Research Fellow}, University of Exeter, 2019-\\
Creation of software pipeline for cross-matching external photometric catalogues to LSST datasets as part of LSST:UK consortium. Requires development of computationally efficient and precise codebase to ensure accurate photometry and astrometry can be obtained for a set of photometric catalogues. Awarded STFC grant.

{\sl Postdoctoral Researcher}, Space Telescope Science Institute, 2018-2019\\
Analysis and optimisation of supernovae survey for future WFIRST observing strategies. Involves solving maximisation problem of information content analysis, and robust statistical analysis of the fitting and modelling of supernovae lightcurves. Software development for \texttt{photutils}, an \texttt{astropy}-affiliated python package, focussing on analysis tools for PSF photometry. Requires code testing and improvements, package maintenance and distribution, and documentation development.

\section{EDUCATION}

{\sl PhD in Physics}, University of Exeter, 2013-2018\\
Main focus of thesis surrounds the effects of blended stars on the astrometric and photometric properties of stars in crowded Galactic fields. Characterisation of photometric catalogues by angular resolution and survey completeness explored, allowing for quantitative comparisons of the crowding suffered. A probability-based Bayesian cross-matching process was constructed, allowing for robust determination of detections across catalogues. Analysed the effect crowding has on the \textit{WISE} catalogue. \\Awarded STFC PhD Studentship. Supervisor: Prof. Tim Naylor

{\sl MPhys in Physics with Astrophysics,} Master's Dissertation, University of Exeter, 2012-2013 \\
Analysis of young stellar cluster ages using the radiative-convective gap as a distance and extinction independent variable. Subsequent analysis of the initial mass function to explore effects of age and distance on masses in stellar clusters. Characterised the effect the choice of magnitudes used in a colour-colour diagram has on the interstellar extinction-age dependency, determining the optimal CCD for age independent extinction derivations for low mass young pre-main-sequence stars. Supervisor: Prof. Tim Naylor

{\sl College Summer Internship}, University of Exeter, 2012\\
Six week undergraduate work experience during undergraduate degree. Initially involved improvements to data reduction for JCMT 450$\mu$m and 850$\mu$m observations. Subsequent work on the construction of temperature and dust $\beta$ maps from these observations, supplemented with \textit{Herschel} data in several cases, concluding with analysis of NGC1333.\\Supervisor: Dr Jennifer Hatchell
