%	OBJECTIVE SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
% \section{RESEARCH INTERESTS}  

% My main interest in astrophysics involves the understanding of early star formation, from cloud core through to cluster evolution along the pre-main-sequence. Specifically, the application of robust statistical methodology to investigations to explore and explain these complex astrophysical processes. Understanding the consequences of the way we observe the universe and characterising how our assumptions influence our conclusions also drive my interests in the field.
